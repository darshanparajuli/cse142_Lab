      <h2>Textbook</h2>
      <p>I don't believe that there is any singularly excellent book on compiler design.
      However, the course will be making use of the following texts.
      Use your own discretion when purchasing.

      <h1>Course Goals</h1>
      <p>This course is programming heavy (some projects about ~1k lines).
      You will implement a compiler for a simple LL(1) language designed specifically for the course.
      Lectures emphasize data structures and design patterns that support the task of parsing, representing, transforming, and evaluating input code.
      Projects put that emphasis into practice.
      By the end of the course you will be able to:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Associate computer language features with the data structures used to implement them.</li>
        <!--<li>Identify the computation model needed for different languages in the Chomsky Hierarchy.</li>-->
        <li>Apply object oriented design patterns and refactorings appropriately in the construction of a software project with strongly interconnected components (i.e. a compiler).</li>
        <li>Design and implement a language transformer (i.e., a compiler).</li>
      </ol>

      <h1>Grades</h1>
      <p>Projects (6 of them): 40% (6.66% each)<br>
      Midterm: 25%<br>
      Final: 35%<br>
      According to our <a href="labs/index.html">late work policy</a>, you have a one-time-use no-questions-asked 48 hr grace period for lab projects. Try to reserve it for real emergencies.
